# 21cmExperiments

The cosmological 21-cm signal is a powerful probe of the early Universe. A vast number of experiments have been proposed to detect this signal. 

A list of these experiments is compiled in a publicly editable Google Sheet at: [bit.ly/21cmExperiments](https://bit.ly/21cmExperiments). This repository contains some simple code to load it on Python if needed (`UsingPython.ipynb`), and the list of publications associated with the experiments (`21cmExperiments.bib`).

**NOTE**: Given the public nature of the Google Sheet, there is no guarantee that the BibTeX file and Python code will always work. However, I will try to keep them updated as much as possible.

# Contributing and attribution

The list is of-course free to use, modify and distribute. No citation is needed. However, if you notice any errors in the list, please feel free to correct it. The publication names are in the format of NASA/ADS bib export. A special thanks to Saptarshi Bandyopadhyay for helping me compile the list, and inspiration to release it as a public resource.

You can always raise a GitHub issue or contact me at [my email](mailto:jvd29@cam.ac.uk) if you have any ideas/questions/suggestions.
